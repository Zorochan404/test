- Application is added with `status: 'pending'`

### 3. Review Applications
- Admin can view all applicants via `/applicants/:id`
- Admin can update applicant status through the hiring process

### 4. Status Management
- **pending**: Initial status when application is submitted
- **reviewed**: Application has been reviewed by HR/recruiter
- **shortlisted**: Applicant is shortlisted for interview
- **rejected**: Application is rejected
- **hired**: Applicant is hired for the position

### 5. Deactivate Post
- When position is filled or no longer accepting applications
- Set `isActive: false` to prevent new applications
