## Database Schema

### PaymentInformation Model

```javascript
{
  // Core Information
  userId: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  courseId: ObjectId (ref: 'Course'),
  programId: String,
  
  // Fee Structure
  totalFee: Number,
  registrationFee: Number,
  processingFee: Number,
  
  // Payment Status
  totalAmountPaid: Number,
  totalAmountDue: Number,
  paymentStatus: String,
  
  // EMI Plan
  emiPlan: {
    totalEmis: Number,
    emiAmount: Number,
    emiFrequency: String,
    emiPayments: [EMIPaymentSchema],
    emisPaid: Number,
    emisRemaining: Number
  },
  
  // Transactions & Coupons
  paymentTransactions: [PaymentTransactionSchema],
  appliedCoupons: [CouponUsageSchema],
  totalDiscount: Number,
  
  // Late Fees
  lateFees: {
    totalLateFees: Number,
    lateFeeRate: Number,
    gracePeriod: Number
  },
  
  // Settings
  autoDebit: {
    enabled: Boolean,
    bankAccount: Object,
    upiId: String
  },
  
  // Status
  isActive: Boolean
}
```

### User Model Integration

The User model includes a reference to payment information:

```javascript
{
  // ... existing user fields
  paymentInformation: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'PaymentInformation'
  }]
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Core Payment Management
- `POST /api/v1/payment-information` - Create payment information
- `GET /api/v1/payment-information/:id` - Get payment by ID
- `GET /api/v1/payment-information/user/:userId` - Get user's payments
- `DELETE /api/v1/payment-information/:id` - Soft delete payment

### Payment Transactions
- `POST /api/v1/payment-information/:id/payment` - Record payment
- `GET /api/v1/payment-information/:id/transactions` - Get transactions

### EMI Management
- `GET /api/v1/payment-information/:id/emi-schedule` - Get EMI schedule
- `POST /api/v1/payment-information/:id/calculate-late-fees` - Calculate late fees

### Coupons & Discounts
- `POST /api/v1/payment-information/:id/coupon` - Apply coupon

### Settings & Configuration
- `PUT /api/v1/payment-information/:id/settings` - Update settings

### Analytics & Reporting
- `GET /api/v1/payment-information/user/:userId/summary` - Payment summary
- `GET /api/v1/payment-information/overdue/all` - Overdue payments

## Key Methods

### Instance Methods

#### `calculateLateFees()`
Calculates late fees for overdue EMI payments based on configured rates and grace periods.

#### `recordPayment(amount, method, transactionId, description)`
Records a payment transaction and automatically updates EMI payments and payment status.

#### `applyCoupon(couponCode, discountAmount, discountType, originalValue)`
Applies a discount coupon to the payment and updates the total amount due.

### Static Methods

#### `findByUserAndCourse(userId, courseId, programId)`
Finds payment information for a specific user-course-program combination.

#### `findOverduePayments()`
Finds all overdue payments across all users for admin monitoring.

## Business Logic

### Payment Status Calculation
- **Pending**: No payments made
- **Partial**: Some payments made but total not reached
- **Completed**: Full payment received
- **Overdue**: EMI payments past due date
- **Defaulted**: Multiple overdue payments

### EMI Payment Processing
1. Payment amount is applied to pending EMIs in order
2. EMI status is updated (pending → partial → paid)
3. Payment status and totals are recalculated
4. Next payment date is updated

### Late Fee Calculation
1. Check each pending EMI for overdue status
2. Calculate late fees based on days overdue and rate
3. Apply grace period before charging late fees
4. Update total amount due

## Integration Points
